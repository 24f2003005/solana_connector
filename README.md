A premium, mobile-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) template built for the Solana ecosystem. This repository serves as a professional boilerplate for developers to create dApps that feel like native Android applications using Google's **Bubblewrap (TWA)** technology.

This project is powered by the **`algobright/solana-connector`**, which utilizes the latest Solana Wallet Adapter standards to ensure seamless connectivity with mobile wallets like Phantom, Solflare, and the Solana Seeker.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Mobile-Native UX:** Enhanced splash screen styling and mobile-intuitive layouts (bottom-tab navigation).
- **Optimized Browser Behavior:** Pre-configured to default to Chrome Custom Tabs with system fallbacks.
- **Advanced Connectivity:** Integrated `algobright/solana-connector` for robust wallet handshakes.
- **TWA Optimized:** Ready-to-use `manifest.json` and an optimized `.gitignore` that keeps your Android signing keys secure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Solana:** `@solana-program/system`, `@solana/kit` ,`@solana/connector`
- **Connector:** `algobright/solana-connector` (Optimized for @solana/kit)
- **Android Wrapper:** Google Bubblewrap (Trusted Web Activity)

---

### 🚀 What's New
- **Solana Integration**: Implemented `algobright/solana-connector` for mobile-native wallet handshakes.
- **PWA Enhancements**: Custom splash screen and standalone display mode for a native Android feel.
- **Bubblewrap TWA**: Successfully converted the web app into a signed APK using Google's TWA standard.

## 🧪 How to Test

- 1. Download the `app-release-signed.apk` attached below.
- 2. Install it on an Android device.
- 3. Open the app and tap "Connect Wallet" to test the mobile-optimized Solana connection.


## 📦 1. Installation & Local Development

### Setup
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/24f2003005/solana_connector.git](https://github.com/24f2003005/solana_connector.git)
cd solana_connector
npm install
```

### Local Testing
To test the UI and Solana logic:

```bash
npm run dev
```
To test PWA features (Service Workers and "Add to Home Screen" prompts), run a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 🌐 2. Deployment (Making it Live)
A PWA must be hosted on a public HTTPS server before it can be converted to an APK.

Deploy to Vercel/Netlify:

Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.

Ensure your manifest.json is accessible at https://your-app.vercel.app/manifest.json.

like as :- https://solanaconnector.vercel.app/manifest.webmanifest

PWA Validation:

Open your live site in Chrome.

Go to Inspect > Lighthouse and run a "PWA" report to ensure 100% compatibility.

## 📱 3. Build the Android APK (via Bubblewrap)
Once your PWA is live, follow these steps to generate the .apk file for the Google Play Store or Solana dApp Store.

Prerequisites
Install the Bubblewrap CLI:

```bash
npm i -g @bubblewrap/cli
```

### Step A: Initialize the Android Project
Create a new directory for your Android build files and initialize:

```bash
mkdir android-build && cd android-build
bubblewrap init --manifest=[https://your-live-pwa-url.com/manifest.json](https://your-live-pwa-url.com/manifest.json)
```

Configuration: Follow the CLI wizard to set your App Name and Launcher Icons.

Signing Key: If you don't have a .keystore file, Bubblewrap will generate one for you. Keep this file and its password safe!

### Step B: Build and Sign
```Bash
bubblewrap build
```
This produces app-release-signed.apk.

Step C: Verification (Digital Asset Links)
To remove the browser URL bar (making it "Full Screen"):

Locate the assetlinks.json file generated by Bubblewrap.

Upload it to your web server at: https://your-domain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json. 

In case of us we used to make like using app/.well-known folder instead of public folder

## 📂 Project Structure
/public: PWA manifest.json and 512x512 icons for the splash screen.

/src: Implementation of the algobright/solana-connector logic.

.gitignore: Configured to ignore node_modules, .next, and sensitive Android .keystore files.
